# LinkedIn Bot ‚Äì Clicks The Platform So You Don‚Äôt Have To

This Python project opens a real Chromium/Chrome browser, signs into LinkedIn, and performs everyday actions for you‚Äîposting, scheduling, uploading images, tagging people, liking, commenting, and running an AI-powered engagement loop. Everything is driven from the command line; no hidden APIs, no browser extensions: the bot simply automates the official web UI with Selenium.

## 1. Quick Start

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

cat <<'ENV' > .env
LINKEDIN_USERNAME=you@example.com
LINKEDIN_PASSWORD=yourLinkedInPassword
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key    # optional (AI comments)
# HEADLESS=false                     # uncomment to watch the browser
ENV

python main.py --post-text "Hello LinkedIn!" --no-ai --debug --headless=false
```

Add `--headless=false` the first few runs so you can watch what‚Äôs happening. Abort with `Ctrl+C` if anything looks wrong‚Äîthe browser closes automatically.

## 2. Features At A Glance

| Capability | What it does |
|------------|--------------|
| Post text | Publish immediately with `--post-text` (skip AI with `--no-ai`). |
| Attach images | Use `--image` (repeatable) or `--images-dir`; bot uploads via the hidden file input. |
| Schedule | Pick date/time via `--schedule-date mm/dd/yyyy` and `--schedule-time "10:45 AM"`. |
| Use/fallback AI | Use Gemini/OpenAI, your topic file, or local templates. Disable with `--no-ai`. |
| Content calendar | `--generate-calendar` creates a 30-day plan (appends to topics file; supports overwrite and defaults when optional fields are skipped). |
| Mentions | Inline `@{Ada Lovelace}`, anchor/name pairs, or auto-tag author (`--mention-author`). |
| Feed one-shots | Like/comment/repost the first visible feed item. |
| Engage stream | Scroll the feed, skip promos, like/comment repeatedly (`--engage-stream`). |
| AI summariser | Sumy condenses posts and logs the full summary before OpenAI writes a reply. |
| Human-like delays | Control pace with `--delay-min/max` and `--scroll-wait-min/max`. |
| Safety guards | Avoid duplicate comments/likes using URNs, hashes, DOM markers, and cached state. |
| **Marketing mode** | Automatically append promotional tails to AI-generated posts/comments with your project details. |

## 4. Common Workflows

### Post plain text
```bash
python main.py --post-text "Hello LinkedIn üëã" --no-ai --debug --headless=false
```

### Post with images
```bash
python main.py \
  --post-text "Shipping screenshots" \
  --images-dir ./static \
  --headless=false --debug
```
- Repeat `--image` for exact files. Supported: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`.

### Schedule a post
```bash
python main.py \
  --post-text "See you tomorrow" \
  --schedule-date 09/16/2025 \
  --schedule-time "10:45 AM" \
  --headless=false --debug
```

### Tag people in a post
```bash
python main.py \
  --post-text "Thanks @{Ada Lovelace}!" \
  --headless=false --debug --no-ai
```
or use anchor/name pairs:
```bash
python main.py \
  --post-text "Thanks for the push" \
  --mention-anchor "for the push" \
  --mention-name "Ada Lovelace"
```

### One-shot like/comment
```bash
python main.py --like-first
python main.py --comment-first "Nice take!" --mention-author
```

### Repost first feed item
```bash
python main.py \
  --repost-first \
  --repost-thoughts "My take üëá" \
  --mention-author \
  --author-mention-position append
```

### Pursue a specific profile (like & comment directly on their posts)
```bash
python main.py pursue "Lara Acosta" \
  --max-posts 5 \
  --perspectives insightful professional \
  --bio-keywords investor venture startup advisor \
  --debug --headless=false
```
- Finds the profile via search (optionally filtering by `--bio-keywords`).
- Clicks **Show all posts** to open the `recent-activity/all` view.
- Scrolls the profile‚Äôs posts feed, liking and (optionally) commenting on the first `--max-posts` visible items without navigating away.
- Comments use AI when an OpenAI key is configured; otherwise fall back to the default text. Mentions of the author are prepended automatically.
- Respect LinkedIn rate limits‚Äîstart with small caps (e.g., `--max-posts 3`) while observing in headful mode.

### Generate a 30-day content calendar
```bash
python main.py \
  --generate-calendar \
  --calendar-niche "fitness" \
  --calendar-goal "educate busy professionals about at-home fitness" \
  --calendar-audience "busy professionals aged 25-40 who struggle to find workout time" \
  --calendar-tone inspirational \
  --calendar-content-type "educational tips" \
  --calendar-content-type "motivational stories" \
  --calendar-frequency "daily posts" \
  --calendar-hashtag "FitnessMotivation" \
  --calendar-hashtag "HomeWorkout" \
  --calendar-inspiration "Kayla Itsines, Chris Hemsworth" \
  --calendar-personal-story "How fitness improved the founder's mental health" \
  --calendar-output Topics.txt \
  --calendar-overwrite
```

- Required flags: `--calendar-niche`, `--calendar-goal`, `--calendar-audience`.
- Optional flags let you tailor tone, content formats, frequency, total posts, hashtags, inspirational accounts, and personal stories. If you skip them the generator falls back to neutral defaults (e.g., ‚Äúa variety of formats‚Äù, ‚Äúrelevant hashtags‚Äù).
- By default the plan appends to `--topics-file`; use `--calendar-output` to choose another file and `--calendar-overwrite` to replace existing content.
- Each idea is written on its own line so you can feed it back into the posting workflow later.

### Engage stream (AI-powered)
```bash
python main.py \
  --engage-stream both \
  --stream-ai \
  --max-actions 5 \
  --mention-author \
  --headless=false --debug
```
- Without `--stream-ai`, supply `--stream-comment "Great point!"`.
- `--infinite` runs until `Ctrl+C`.
- Adjust pacing: `--delay-min 2 --delay-max 5`, `--scroll-wait-min 2 --scroll-wait-max 4`.

During AI runs you‚Äôll see lines like:
```
ENGAGE_AI summary: As developers, it‚Äôs easy to fall into the trap‚Ä¶
COMMENT_ORDER mention=prepend
MENTIONS_SELECT prefer_first=yes selected=True
```
These confirm the summary and mention steps succeeded.

## 5. Engage Stream Safety & De-duplication

- **Order**: comment first, then like. In comment-only mode, a courtesy Like is added but not counted.
- **De-dup cache**: URNs and text hashes persist in `logs/engage_state.json` (7-day TTL). Delete this file to reset history.
- **Skip logic**: checks for prior likes, existing ‚ÄúYou‚Äù comments, and similar comment text before posting.
- **Promoted posts**: skipped unless `--include-promoted`.
- **Mentions**: author mention is forced to the caret start when using AI, ensuring LinkedIn‚Äôs typeahead picks the first suggestion. If typeahead fails, the bot leaves a plain `@name` so text still reads naturally.
- **Topic history**: successfully posted topics are removed from the source file and appended (with timestamps) to `<topics>_posted.<ext>` so you always know what has gone out.

Troubleshooting duplicates:
1. Run headful with `--debug` and a small cap.
2. Inspect the log for `ENGAGE_SKIP reason=...` to see why a post was skipped or processed.
3. Make sure the author name appears in the feed DOM; adjust selectors in `linkedin_ui/engage_dom.py` if you notice missing names.

---

## 6. AI Notes

- **Summaries**: Sumy TextRank condenses long posts and normalises whitespace (no newlines/excess spaces) before hitting OpenAI.
- **Comments**: `openai_client.py` uses style hints; you can tweak them to allow emojis, change tone, or shorten responses.
- **Token billing**: everything you send (including spaces and line breaks) counts as tokens.
- **Fallbacks**: if OpenAI/Gemini fail, the bot falls back to `CUSTOM_POSTS_FILE` templates, then to randomised phrases.

### Bot in Action

![LinkedIn comment impressions generated by the bot](static/bot%20evidence.jpeg)

> The bot also drives meaningful engagement‚Äîthis screenshot shows one of its comments reaching over 600 impressions.


### Documentation & Introspection

- Every module, class, and function now ships with Why/When/How docstrings so you can `help()` anything in the stack and understand intent quickly.
- Re-run the bot with `--debug` to see the enriched logging alongside the new structured docs if you are auditing behaviour.
- Export docs into plain text with:
  ```bash
  python - <<'PY'
  import inspect
  from linkedin_bot import LinkedInBot

  print(inspect.getdoc(LinkedInBot.post_custom_text))
  PY
  ```
  The output mirrors the new docstring format (What/Why/When/How, Args, Returns), making it easy to embed in your own runbooks.

## 7. Configuration Reference

| Location | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `.env` | Credentials, API keys, default headless mode, etc. |
| `config.py` | Constants (selectors, timeouts, logging format, user agent). |
| `linkedin_ui/` | Modular Selenium mixins (login, composer, mentions, engage, etc.). |
| `logs/` | Run logs + engage cache (`engage_state.json`). |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies. |

Reset the engage cache by deleting `logs/engage_state.json`.

## 8. Safety Checklist

- Follow LinkedIn‚Äôs Terms. Use humane delays and sensible limits.
- Start with `--headless=false --debug` so you understand each step.
- Store `.env` securely. Consider a separate account for testing.
- Review logs periodically to confirm mention placement and summary output.
