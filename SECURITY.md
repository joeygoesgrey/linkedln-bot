# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue or vulnerability:

1. **Do not create a public GitHub issue.**
2. Email the maintainer or open a private discussion channel if available.
3. Include the steps to reproduce, possible impact, and any suggested fixes.
4. Please allow a reasonable time for remediation before disclosing publicly.

If you cannot reach the maintainer directly, mark the issue as `security` and
describe the vulnerability without including sensitive details.

## Supported Versions

The project currently supports the latest commit on the `main` branch. Older
commits are maintained on a best-effort basis.
